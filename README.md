# Energia-Trading-Strategy

• Accomplished optimization of electricity procurement for Energia by developing data-driven trading strategies utilizing statistical forecasting models to predict market prices across DAM, IDA1, IDA2, IDA3 and BM, enabling cost minimization and profit maximization.

• Led extensive time series analysis including seasonal-trend decomposition with LOESS (STL) and Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling on the multivariate time series dataset with 39,354 observations to produce 1-day ahead price forecasts while accounting for lagged values and interdependencies.

• Directed insightful exploratory data analysis using statistical techniques like correlation analysis and data visualizations, uncovering key relationships between predictor variables like wind energy production, gas prices, demand, and the profitability of trading in different electricity markets.

• Improved trading decisions and risk management by creating a Random Forest regressor model to predict volatile BM market prices, establishing a £100 per MW hour threshold price above which BM trades would not be made to avoid losses from volatility.

• Evaluated comparative performance of trading strategies by leveraging visualizations and statistical analysis like minimum price market counts to compare profitability of each market in relation to DAM for purchasing 100MW over 48 half-hour intervals.

• Achieved optimized electricity procurement for Energia by leveraging predictive modeling and data analytics techniques to design a robust trading strategy balancing cost minimization and profit maximization based on historical market dynamics and price predictor variables.
